# PathfinderVisualisation

The Pathfinder Visualization project is an interactive tool that provides a visual representation of various pathfinding algorithms. The project offers an intuitive user interface where users can create custom environments by defining obstacles and specifying start and target point. It supports multiple well-known pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm, A* search, BFS and DFS algorithm. The visualization provides step-by-step animation, allowing users to observe how these algorithms navigate through the environment and find the most efficient paths.
